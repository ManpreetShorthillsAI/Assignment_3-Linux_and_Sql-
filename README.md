SQL:-
Database Creation:
We created a new database called company_db to store our data.

Table Creation:
We created two tables:
departments: This table holds information about different departments, including:
department_id (unique identifier)
department_name (name of the department)

employees: This table contains details about employees, including:
employee_id (unique identifier)
employee_name (name of the employee)
department_id (links the employee to a department)
salary (employee's salary)
hire_date (date when the employee was hired)

Data Insertion:
We added sample data to both tables:
departments: We filled it with five departments like Sales, Engineering, and Finance.
employees: We added five employees with their names, salaries, and hire dates.

Checking the Data:
We learned how to connect to the MySQL database from the terminal.
We executed SQL commands to view the data in both the departments and employees tables.

Running SQL from a File:
We created an SQL file to store our commands, making it easy to run multiple commands at once.
We executed this file to see the data, and we also learned how to save the output to another file for later review.
